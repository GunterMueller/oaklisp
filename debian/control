Description: An object-oriented dialect of Scheme.
 Oaklisp is a dialect of Scheme that combines full lexical scoping
 with first-class types.  It uses a byte-coded implementation, but is
 reasonably fast anyway.  Complete with bignums, formatted output,
 transparent delays, RnRS compatibility package, all the luxuries.
