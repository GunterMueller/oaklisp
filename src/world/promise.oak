;;; NOTE: Neither of these are actually activated, because IS-A? is really
;;; critical, and we don't want to actually slow down the system.  Load one
;;; if you actually want to use promises and want things that do TYPECASE
;;; to work on them.  All the type predicates use IS-A? (see predicates.oak)
;;; so this should make them automatically force delays too.  On the other
;;; hand, the type predicates could be switched to use dispatch without
;;; warning upon suitable benchmarks.

;;; A patch to do similar things to the system predicates is commented out
;;; in predicates.oak

;;; Not modular, but maybe faster:
(define (is-a? obj typ)
  (iterate is-a? ((obj obj))
    (let ((typ2 (get-type obj)))
      (if (and forcible-magic (subtype typ2 forcible))
	  (is-a? (force obj) typ)
	  (subtype? typ2 typ)))))

;;; Modular, but maybe slower:
(add-method (is-a? (forcible) self typ)
  (if forcible-magic
      (is-a? (force self) typ)
      (^super object is-a? self typ)))
