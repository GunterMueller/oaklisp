;;; TO DO

;;; register for # instructions until alarms ?
;;; at least make interval modifiable

;;; change C thread maker so malloc'ed stuff doesn't get into oaklisp space

;;; rationalize process descriptor table C vs Oaklisp interface

;;; process priorities

;;; make threads extra "level" in build process.  Prior to that being
;;; loaded, NO THREAD STUFF AT ALL.

;;; ability to build emulator without thread support

;;; race conditions (symbol tables, hash tables, add-method)

;;; performance

;;; make sure throwing out of thread gets an error


;;; completely rewrite allocation subsystem
