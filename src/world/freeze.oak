;; The locale structure looks like this:
;;
;;                     SYSTEM   
;;                     /    \   
;;               COMPILER  SYSTEM-INTERNALS
;;               /     \    
;;         SCRATCH   COMPILER-INTERNALS
;;

;; System-locale gets filled in from the boot world by patch-locales.oak.
