;;; Define a kind of type that can be coerced to.  Such types have a
;;; coercer operation, which can be applied to an instance of some other
;;; type in order to coerce it to this type.  For example, to coerce a
;;; number X to floating point, write ((COERCER FLOAT) X) or, with read
;;; macros, (FLOAT X).

;;; This definition goes in "KERNEL" so primitive types can be coercable.
