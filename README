This is the Oaklisp source distribution.
See http://www.cs.unm.edu/~bap/oaklisp/ for the updates.


*** GETTING IT WORKING ***

 Oaklisp should be straightforward to install on a virgin machine.
 You need to compile some C source to make the emulator:

   make -C src/emulator prefix=/usr/local \
    CPPFLAGS='-DFAST -DDEFAULT_WORLD=\"/usr/local/lib/oaklisp/oakworld.bin\"' \
    install

 Then you need to put the recompiled binary world it will use in place:

   cp -a src/world/oakworld.bin /usr/local/lib/oaklisp/

 Now invoking /usr/local/bin/oaklisp should land you in an Oaklisp
 read-eval-print loop.


*** INSTALLING DOCUMENTATION ***

Probably you should

  cd man; make prefix=/usr/local install

The language and implementation manuals are in doc/lang/lang.ps and
doc/lim/lim.ps.  They are latex source but include working Makefiles.
You should be able to build and install them with

  mkdir --parents /usr/local/doc/oaklisp
  cd doc; make prefix=/usr/local install


*** BUILDING A NEW WORLD ***

Note that Oaklisp is written in Oaklisp, so you must have a working
Oaklisp before you can rebuild the Oaklisp world, which is done via

 make -C src/world prefix=/usr/local install

In fact, you should be able to rebuild and reinstall *everything* via

  make prefix=/usr/local install

in this top level directory.
